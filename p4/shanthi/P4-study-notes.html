	<strong>What will I learn?</strong>

	You will learn about the critical rendering path, the process by which the browser receives HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the required processing to turn them into rendered pixels. Youâ€™ll also start to think of your work as a continuously running web application that requires a consistent framerate to produce the most enjoyable user experience.

	Download the project and ngrok from:

	Project Overview

	https://github.com/udacity/fend-office-hours/tree/master/Web%20Optimization/Project%204%20Overview

	You will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

	How will I complete this project?

	Review our course on Website Performance Optimization using Google PageSpeed.
	Download the required project assets.
	Use Chrome Developer Tools to review the current state of various pages within the application and identify areas for improvement.
	Review the code powering the website and identify areas where you believe modifications are warranted.
	Iteratively make changes and test those changes using the tools available to you to determine if they are a performance gain or loss.

	What is required:
	1)Pagespeed insights only on index.html - Critical rendering path only for this.
	user experience and speed score is  90 or above for both desktop and mobile
	2)Optimisation and frames per sec(using google dev. tools. Chrome -> more tools -> developer tools) is on pizza.html
	3)content efficieny - minify JS, making them async, making them load after html body loaded , images etc..resize /optimize images
	search for minifiers online (u need 2 sets, one prebuilt unminified, other Prod. quality - minified and refer the minified from your html files.)
	just use an online minifier.
	Provide both the minified and unminifed version while submitting

	3.a)to exceed spec:
	u can use grunt.js, gulp.js
	download gulp.js, run commands from within ur project folder. it will set up bunch of diff. files, create minfied js
	gulp also does image optimisation

	Grunt also works the same way.


	4)add Comments where changes are made ...readme , if gulp/grunt used let know in readme. and documentation
	quick bullet in readme :
	indicating changes in main.js file

	For Part 1:
	For Part 1, the only thing that matters for evaluation is the PageSpeed score. If you were were building your own website, you might want to use one of the techniques described in Udacity's Responsive Images
	https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882

	For Part 2:
	https://github.com/udacity/fend-office-hours/tree/master/Web%20Optimization/Effective%20Optimizations%20for%2060%20FPS

	Steps where to start this project:
	1) Download the files from github to my local comp.
	2) Now ngrok it to host the webpage online
		- What ngrok does is it creates a tunnel from localhost so you can see how page appears on public Internet and to do that u have to first host ur page on localhost
	3) From the terminal, go to the dir. where the web pages reside and here host my page on the localhost
	python -m .......command
	4)now goto localhost on web browser (http://localhost:8080/) you can see the index.html
	But this is on my local server you need to get it online to check the page on pagespeed
	thats why ngrok is used
	(u can also host on giuthub.io)
	5)now open new tab in terminal

	Process of rendering a page :
	Example
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" type="text/css"></link>
			<script src="js/app.js"></script>
		</head>
		<body>
		</body>
	</html>
	Steps: (CRP - Critical Rendering Path)
	1) Begin constructing the DOM by parsing the HTML(DOM construction is incremental and the response may not arrive all at once, so we may not finish constructing it all at once)
	2) Request CSS and JS resources
	3) Parse CSS and construct the CSSOM tree(The script is synchronous so we cannot execute it until we have the CSSOM. So we will have to create the CSSOM ASAP. Completeing the CSSOM, will unblock the JS Engine so we will be able to execute JS as soon as we have received it. Once the JS is done, we can resume and finish constructing the DOM)
	4) Execute JS
	5) Merge DOM and CSSOM into the Render Tree
	6) Run Layout, Paint page.

	Notes:
	CSS blocks rendering and also blocks JS execeution.Thats why optimizing CSS is so important
	Analytics dont block rendering(say some JS call to some alaytics func.)

	https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/adding-interactivity-with-javascript#parser-blocking-vs-asynchronous-javascript

	Rules to remember for CRP:
	1) Minify, Compress, Cache . All 3 rules apply to HTML,CSS and JS.
    2) Minimize the use of render blocking resources (CSS)
    	Way to do it:
    	1) Use media queries on <link> to unblock rendering
    	2) Inline CSS
    3) Min. the use of Parser blocking resources (JS blocks the document parser)
    	To do it:
    	1) Defer the JS execution
    	2) Or, use ansync attribute on the script tag

    In general the bucket you see, you have to reduce the bytes sent over the network, the faster the Browser gets the data then it can render the page
    	1) Min. the Bytes (looking at point 1 above)
    	2) Reduce the no: of critical resources(from points 2 and 3 the inference)
    	3) Shorten the CRP length

	Web Perf. Optimization:
	3 main objectives (CRP):
	1) Reduce the Critical Bytes
	2) Reduce the no: of critical resources
	3) Shortening the Critical Path Length

	Repo portfolio:
	analyse by Drawing CRP
	Diagnose the Critical Path measures
