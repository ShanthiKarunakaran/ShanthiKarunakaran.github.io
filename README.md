Project name :
	- Create an interactive online resume
Challenge :
	- Write clean code and use objects, JSON, functions and control flow.
Criteria :
	- All resume data has to be loaded dynamically using JSON.
How the JS project files were organized:
	helper.js
		 - contained all the code for the HTML strings
	resumebuilder.js
		- This is where i wrote all the JS objects for the different sections in the page such as work, projects, education.
		- JS functions replaced the %data% in the HTML strings (in helper.js)
		- All functions were encapsulated inside each JS object. Functions were modular and could be called in any order.
Additonal Interactivity (that exceeded the Project rubric):
		- I added additional interactivity to the project by adding menu bar navigation to jump to the respective sections in the resume page.
		- Google map interactivity was added as well by showing more information for the chosen location in the map when the location was clicked.
		- I changed the HTML layout from the given simple mockup to make it more interesting , to adhere to Bootstrap grid layout
		- I made the resume page Responsive.
